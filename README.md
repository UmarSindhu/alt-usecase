Welcome to my portfolio! **Alt Usecase** is a creative web application I developed to demonstrate my skills in full-stack development. This fun app uses AI to generate imaginative and often hilarious alternative uses for any item. It serves as a practical example of integrating modern frontend and backend technologies with a third-party AI service.
